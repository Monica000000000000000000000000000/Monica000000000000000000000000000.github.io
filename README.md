    <p class="Quation1">1A. What need did you identify? Why was addressing this need important to you? Minimum 100 words*</p>

    <p class="Answer">I am currently working on creating an educational app for kids in the easiest way possible. The educational system in 
        my country is lacking, and I want to provide a fun and engaging way for children to learn. The app will start with a 'Learn How to 
        Learn' course, which will be specifically designed for children's understanding. After that, they will learn English and eventually 
        programming languages based on their interests. The app also includes a chat feature that allows kids to help each other and earn 
        power points in the process. My plan is to make the app a game, so the kids don't even realize they're learning. At the end of the 
        game, the winner will be tested on what they have learned and the projects they have designed. Depending on their age, they will 
        receive an award or scholarship as a reward for their hard work.</p>

        <hr>
    <p class="Quation">1B. What specific actions did you take to address the need? If your initiative is unfinished, what actions do you still plan to take? Minimum 150 words*</p>
    <p class="Answer">Now I'm working on improving my programming skills in Python and Java, as well as my English. I'm also learning about 
        (UI/UX) and how to make them more attractive to children. I believe that by incorporating fun colors, clear explanations, and popular
         games, children will be more engaged and able to benefit the most from the application.
        In order to expand the reach of the application, I plan to build relationships with schools and universities. I believe that by 
        partnering with these institutions, we can recognize the certificate of completion from the application as a sign of true proficiency 
        in language and programming skills. 
        This app will be the easiest for children to use and will provide them with the most benefit. I believe that whoever can complete 
        this program has a high level of intelligence, as it will require learning a new language, programming in various branches, 
        and gaining knowledge in commerce.</p>

        <hr>
    <p class="Quation">1C. Whether it is finished or unfinished, how do you measure the success of the initiative? Minimum 100 words *</p>

    <p class="Answer">I think it will be a great success. It will attract children because it is both a game and an educational tool at the
         same time. Since the application focuses on the English language and programming, parents will encourage their children to play this
          game. Additionally, since the application is still under development, there will be many additional features and resources added in
           the future to keep pace with the times and enhance its effectiveness. Through regular use of this app, children will gain a great 
           deal of experience and knowledge, which will ultimately give them a valuable advantage in their childhood.</p>

        <hr>
    <p class="Quation">1D. What difficulties did you encounter? Were you able to overcome them and how? Minimum 100 words *</p>

    <p class="Answer">At first, I had difficulty organizing my time between studying, my family, and the things I wanted to learn in order 
        to achieve my goals without getting distracted. I am trying to stick to my schedule, and I am still learning about time management. 
        I am improving and becoming better at sticking to my schedule, but it is still somewhat challenging for me due to distractions. 
        I make sure to allocate time for entertainment and spending time with my family, cats and friends. I hope to achieve my goal, which
         is to allocate time for work and time for myself.</p>

        <hr>
    <p class="Quation">1E. What one lesson did you learn from this experience? What one thing would you do differently if you were to address the need again? Minimum 100 words *</p>
    <p class="Answer">I used to think that only rich people were successful, but that was just a myth. I have learned to take better care of
         myself and focus on personal development instead of watching useless series. However, I admit that there are some series that have 
         had a positive impact on my personality. But I wouldn't change anything if I could go back. because of my past experiences, I have 
         realized many things, my personality has improved, and I have become more mature. I have learned not to feel so sad when I lose 
         something because I believe that God has plans for me. And I have come to realize that everything we face is an opportunity for a
          new beginning.</p>

        <hr>
    <p class="Quation">2A. Who is a leader, past or present, in your local or the global community, that you find inspiring? Which of their achievements inspire you? Minimum 75 words *</p>
    <p class="Answer">Jim Kwik is a brain coach who taught me how to memorize a lot of things without forgetting them. His teaching methods 
        were so effective that I was able to study for only a few hours a day. Not only that, but I also learned from him how to read quickly,
         which has helped me tremendously in my studies and in life in general when it comes to reading books. Thanks to him, I now have more 
         time to spend with my family while still excelling in my academics.</p>

      <hr>
    <p class="Quation">2B. How has this leader shaped your definition of leadership? What is one specific behavior you have adopted because of this leader? Minimum 100 words *</p>
    <p class="Answer"> He said that he had experienced a life-changing accident when he was young that took away his ability to read and 
        remember things. Unfortunately, this led to him being bullied by others because of his condition. However, he didn't let that stop 
        him from persevering and learning how to remember things easily and read quickly. Thanks to him, I too am learning how to improve my 
        memory and language skills effortlessly. I appreciate his inspiring story because it helps me stay motivated and not worry about what
         others may think. Despite being called hurtful names like "broken mind," he was able to become a successful brain coach. I like his 
         way of proving himself.</p>

        <hr>
    <p class="Quation">2C. Leaders make mistakes too. Consider one this leader has made and explain what you will do differently from them? Minimum 100 words *</p>
    <p class="Answer">Jim Kwik is a well-known figure in the fields of accelerated learning and memory improvement. He has accomplished a lot,
         but like anyone in a leadership position, he is not immune to making mistakes. It is essential to promote cognitive growth and 
         personal development, but it is equally important to report any potential drawbacks or limitations of particular strategies. For 
         example, methods that claim to enhance memory and learning quickly should be discussed alongside the importance of patience, 
         practice, and individual differences in cognitive abilities. By doing this, we can prevent feelings of failure and potential 
         frustration among learners. Content should be made available to all individuals, regardless of their abilities or limitations, 
         and provide texts, captions and sign language.</p>

        <hr>
    <p class="Quation">3A. Why did you select this piece of work? *</p>
    <p class="Answer">When I paint, it's as if I'm transported to a secluded world where nothing else exists. It's a place where I can pour 
        my thoughts and feelings out on paper, and it's very relaxing. Drawing has helped me express things that are difficult to describe 
        in words, and it has taught me a lot. I became very skilled with my pen, and I also learned to write with both hands. Additionally, 
        I've started experimenting with drawing with both hands as well, which has been fun and challenging. I can't express how much learning
         to draw has helped me. It was a positive experience, and I am grateful for it. Without it, I think I would feel lonely.</p>
      
          <hr>
    <p class="Quation">3B. How have you built, or will you build, on your chosen piece of work? *</p>
    <p class="Answer">I will draw webtoons like Japanese manga, but I realize that my drawing skills need to improve before I can bring those
         stories to life. I draw a lot and try to develop my drawing skills so that I can feel confident in my abilities and produce good 
         work.</p>
      
         <hr>
    <p class="Quation">1. Please list the two most important awards, either academic or extracurricular, that you have won below. You may attach documentation as proof, if available. Please ensure your information includes the year of your award and the awarding organization. Uploading documentation is not required.*</p>
    <p class="Answer">I've had some prior experiences in various activities, such as karate, although I couldn't continue due to my father's 
        refusal to let his daughter participate in a martial sport. Nevertheless, I managed to earn a yellow belt for beginners, along with a 
        certificate and a bronze medal. Additionally, I was a member of the church scout team, a commitment I've held since my second-grade 
        year in primary school until my third year of preparatory school. We had many fantastic and enjoyable activities there.</p>

    <p class="Quation">2. We recognize that applicants may have information, circumstances, or qualifications that are not reflected in this application through the other questions that we ask. Do you have anything additional to add to your application? This can include (but is not limited to) changes in educational systems, COVID-19 impact on your family, or accomplishments or work that do not fit into the other application questions.</p>
    <p class="Answer">The coronavirus quarantine has made me a calmer person, and I enjoy trying to analyze someone's character based on their
         actions before getting to know them. This makes it more enjoyable for me.
        The coronavirus epidemic has also had a negative impact on me, resulting in poor grades in my studies in 2021.</p>
        
        <hr>
    <p class="Quation">3. If you have additional work or accomplishments that you are exceptionally proud of, we encourage you to share those with us. This could include videos, websites, portfolios, artwork of any form, blog posts, articles written about you, etc.</p>
    <p class="Answer">I create gypsum shapes for children to color.
        I also design handbags for women.
        I develop websites.
        I collect video edits from others, combine them, and create something new with their videos.</p>
