    <p class="Quation1">1A. What need did you identify? Why was addressing this need important to you? Minimum 100 words*</p>
    <p class="Answer">I am currently working on creating an educational app for kids in the easiest way. The educational system in my country is lacking, and I want to provide a fun and engaging way for children to learn. The app will start with a 'Learn How to Learn' course, which will be specifically designed for children's understanding. After that, they will learn English, and eventually programming languages based on their interests. The app also includes a chat feature that allows kids to help each other and earn power points in the process. My plan is to make the app a game, so the kids don't even realize they're learning. At the end of the game, the winner will be tested on what they have learned and the projects they have designed. Depending on their age, they will receive an award or scholarship as a reward for their hard work.</p>
        <hr>
    <p class="Quation">1B. What specific actions did you take to address the need? If your initiative is unfinished, what actions do you still plan to take? Minimum 150 words*</p>
    <p class="Answer">Now I'm working on improving my programming skills in Python and Java, as well as my English. I'm also learning about (UI/UX) and how making them more attractive to children. I believe that by incorporating fun colors, clear explanations, and popular games, children will be more engaged and able to benefit the most from the application.
        In order to expand the reach of the application, I plan to build relationships with schools and universities. I believe that by partnering with these institutions, we can recognize the certificate of completion from the application as a sign of true proficiency in language and programming skills. 
        This app will be in the easiest way for children to use and will provide them with the most benefit. I believe that whoever can complete this program has a high level of intelligence, as it will require learning a new language, programming in various branches, and gaining knowledge in commerce</p>
        <hr>
    <p class="Quation">1C. Whether it is finished or unfinished, how do you measure the success of the initiative? Minimum 100 words *</p>
    <p class="Answer">I think it will be a great success, It will attract children well because it is a game and an education at the same time. Since the application focuses on the English language and programming, parents will encourage their children to play this game, and since the application is still under development, there will be many additional features and resources that will be added in the future to keep pace with the times and enhance its effectiveness. Through regular use of this app, children will gain a great deal of experience and knowledge, which will ultimately give them a very valuable advantage from their childhood.</p>
        <hr>
    <p class="Quation">1D. What difficulties did you encounter? Were you able to overcome them and how? Minimum 100 words *</p>
    <p class="Answer">At first, I was having difficulty organizing my time between studying, my family, and the things I wanted to learn to achieve my goals and not get distracted. I try to stick to my schedule, and I'm still learning things to time management. I'm getting better at this and getting better at sticking to my schedule, but it's still somewhat difficult for me due to distraction, and I make sure to allocate time to entertain myself and go out with my family, and I hope to achieve my goal, which is to allocate time for work and time for myself.</p>
        <hr>
    <p class="Quation">1E. What one lesson did you learn from this experience? What one thing would you do differently if you were to address the need again? Minimum 100 words *</p>
    <p class="Answer">I used to think that only rich people were successful, but that was just a myth. I learned to take care of myself more and keep developing myself instead of watching useless series, but I admit that there are some series that had a positive impact on my personality. But I wouldn't change anything if I came back. Because of the past, I realized many things, my personality improved, and I became more mature. I have learned not to feel so sad when I lose something because God has plans for me. And I realized that everything we face is an opportunity for a new ending.</p>

    <p class="Quation">2A. Who is a leader, past or present, in your local or the global community, that you find inspiring? Which of their achievements inspire you? Minimum 75 words *</p>
    <p class="Answer">Jim Kwik, he is a brain coach who taught me how to memorize a lot of things without forgetting them. His teaching methods were so effective that I was able to study for only a few hours a day. Not only that, but I also learned from him how to read quickly, which has helped me tremendously in my studies and in life in general when it comes to reading books. Thanks to him, I now have more time to spend with my family while still good in my academics.</p>
      <hr>
    <p class="Quation">2B. How has this leader shaped your definition of leadership? What is one specific behavior you have adopted because of this leader? Minimum 100 words *</p>
    <p class="Answer"> He said that he had experienced a life-changing accident when he was young that took away his ability to read and remember things. Unfortunately, this led to him being bullied by others because of his condition. However, he didn't let that stop him from persevering and learning how to remember things easily and read quickly. Thanks to him, I too am learning how to improve my memory and language skills effortlessly. I appreciate his inspiring story because it helps me to stay motivated and not worry about what others may think. Despite being called hurtful names like "broken mind," he was able to become a successful brain coach, I like his way in proving himself</p>
        <hr>
    <p class="Quation">2C. Leaders make mistakes too. Consider one this leader has made and explain what you will do differently from them? Minimum 100 words *</p>
    <p class="Answer">Jim Kwik is a well-known figure in the field of accelerated learning and memory improvement. He has accomplished a lot, but like anyone in a leadership position, he is not immune to making mistakes. It is essential to promote cognitive growth and personal development, but it is equally important to report any potential drawbacks or limitations of particular strategies. For example, methods that claim to enhance memory and learning quickly should be discussed alongside the importance of patience, practice, and individual differences in cognitive abilities. By doing this, we can prevent feelings of failure and potential frustration among learners. Content should be made available to all individuals, regardless of their abilities or limitations, and provide texts, captions and sign language.</p>

    <p class="Quation">3A. Why did you select this piece of work? *</p>
    <p class="Answer">When I paint, it's as if I'm transported to a secluded world where nothing else exists. It's a place where I can pour my thoughts and feelings out on paper, and it's very relaxing. Drawing has helped me express things that are difficult to describe in words, and it has taught me a lot. I became very skilled with my pen, and I also learned to write with both hands. Additionally, I've started experimenting with drawing with both hands as well, which has been fun and challenging. I can't express how much learning to draw has helped me. It was a positive experience, and I am grateful for it. Without it, I think I would feel lonely.</p>
      <hr>
    <p class="Quation">3B. How have you built, or will you build, on your chosen piece of work? *</p>
    <p class="Answer">I will draw webtoon like Japanese manga, but I realize that my drawing skills need to improve before I can bring those stories to life. I draw a lot and try to develop my drawing skills so that I can feel confident in my abilities and produce good work.</p>

Please ensure your information includes the year of your award and the awarding organization. Uploading documentation is not required.*</p>
    <p class="Answer">I've had some prior experiences in different activities, like karate, although I couldn't continue it due to my father's refusing to have his daughter participate in a martial sport. Nevertheless, I managed to earn a yellow belt for beginners, along with a certificate and a bronze medal. Additionally, I was a member of the church scout team, a commitment I've held since my second-grade year in primary school up until my third year of preparatory school. We had a lot of fantastic and enjoyable activities to do there.</p>

This can include (but is not limited to) changes in educational systems, COVID-19 impact on your family, or accomplishments or work that do not fit into the other application questions.</p>
    <p class="Answer">The Corona quarantine has made me a calm person, and I like to try to analyze the character based on his actions before getting to know him and this makes it more fun.

        The Corona epidemic also affected me negatively, and because of it, I got bad grades in my studies in 2021</p>
        <hr>
    <p class="Quation">3. If you have additional work or accomplishments that you are exceptionally proud of, we encourage you to share those with us. This could include videos, websites, portfolios, artwork of any form, blog posts, articles written about you, etc.</p>
    <p class="Answer">I make gypsum shapes for children to color. 
        I also make handbags for women. 
        I make websites.
        I collect video editing from others and combine them and make something new with their videos. </p>
